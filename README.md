<p>

- time limit per test: 1 second
- memory limit per test: 64 megabytes
- input: standard input
- output: standard output
 
One hot summer day Pete and his friend Billy decided to buy a watermelon. They chose the biggest and the ripest one, in their opinion. After that the watermelon was weighed, and the scales showed w kilos. They rushed home, dying of thirst, and decided to divide the berry, however they faced a hard problem.
 
Pete and Billy are great fans of even numbers, that's why they want to divide the watermelon in such a way that each of the two parts weighs even number of kilos, at the same time it is not obligatory that the parts are equal. The boys are extremely tired and want to start their meal as soon as possible, that's why you should help them and find out, if they can divide the watermelon in the way they want. For sure, each of them should get a part of positive weight.
Input
 
The first (and the only) input line contains integer number w (1 ≤ w ≤ 100) — the weight of the watermelon bought by the boys.
Output
 
Print YES, if the boys can divide the watermelon into two parts, each of them weighing even number of kilos; and NO in the opposite case.
 
#Examples
 
##Input
8
 
## Output
YES
 
## Note
For example, the boys can divide the watermelon into two parts of 2 and 6 kilos respectively (another variant — two parts of 4 and 4 kilos).

Theatre Square in the capital city of Berland has a rectangular shape with the size n × m meters. On the occasion of the city's anniversary, a decision was taken to pave the Square with square granite flagstones. Each flagstone is of the size a × a.
 
What is the least number of flagstones needed to pave the Square? It's allowed to cover the surface larger than the Theatre Square, but the Square has to be covered. It's not allowed to break the flagstones. The sides of flagstones should be parallel to the sides of the Square.
 
# Input
The input contains three positive integer numbers in the first line: n,  m and a (1 ≤  n, m, a ≤ 109).
# Output
Write the needed number of flagstones.
 
# Examples
## Input

<details><summary>A. Way Too Long Words</summary>
<p>

-	time limit per test: 1 second
-	memory limit per test: 256 megabytes
-	input: standard input
-	output: standard output
 
Sometimes some words like "localization" or "internationalization" are so long that writing them many times in one text is quite tiresome.
 
Let's consider a word too long, if its length is strictly more than 10 characters. All too long words should be replaced with a special abbreviation.
 
This abbreviation is made like this: we write down the first and the last letter of a word and between them we write the number of letters between the first and the last letters. That number is in decimal system and doesn't contain any leading zeroes.
 
Thus, "localization" will be spelt as "l10n", and "internationalization» will be spelt as "i18n".
 
You are suggested to automatize the process of changing the words with abbreviations. At that all too long words should be replaced by the abbreviation and the words that are not too long should not undergo any changes.
 
# Input
 
The first line contains an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 100). Each of the following n lines contains one word. All the words consist of lowercase Latin letters and possess the lengths of from 1 to 100 characters.
 
# Output
Print n lines. The i-th line should contain the result of replacing of the i-th word from the input data.
 
# Examples
## Input
4
word
localization
internationalization

## Output
